---

## 1. Project Idea

I developed Kajoo as a medium-priced men's streetwear brand targeting males aged 18–35 living in urban cities across Egypt. The brand focuses on providing modern, casual clothing suitable for university students and young professionals.

The objective of this project is to design and implement a structured digital marketing campaign to build brand awareness, generate engagement, and drive potential online sales.

The Egyptian men's fashion market is competitive but continues to grow through social media exposure and digital purchasing behavior.

### Target Audience:

Kajoo positions itself as a balanced option between price, quality, and identity.
